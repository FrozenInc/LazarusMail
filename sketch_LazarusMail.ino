// This is the code for the Arduino controlling Lazarus mail
// It has the following parts:
// 3 digital sensors
// 1 analog sensor
// 1 stepper motor with coresponding controller accepting: direction, steps, sleep, reset


// Setup is not needed as eveything is determinated in the loop at every run
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:

}

// Loop checks all the sensors and decides if the elevator should move and at what direction
void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
